You can always launch a new campaign, with better chances of reaching your funding goal next time around.","slide2_title":"Why is there a 60-day maximum for project length?","slide2_description":"We’ve found that momentum plays a big role in the success of a project. Adding a sense of excitement (the thrill of being an early backer) or urgency (the final days or hours of a campaign) motivates your community to spread the word and rally behind your project. In our experience, lengthier project timelines tend to extend the lull period in between these two energetic moments, with little benefit to creators or backers. {{ learnMoreLink }}"},"project_image":{"read_more_link":"Read more tips","slide1_title":"What specs should I use?","slide1_description":"Select an image that looks good as a small thumbnail — the dimensions should be at least 1024 x 576, the ratio 16:9, and the width at least 1024 pixels.","slide2_title":"What kind of image should I choose?","slide2_description_part1":"Since the image will be the first thing people see when they find your project, keep it simple and pick something that truly captures what you’re doing, who you’re working with, or what you’re working toward.","slide2_description_part2":"If you’re working on a food project, take a beautiful shot of a culinary spread; if you’re working on a new album, share the artwork you might use; if you’re working on a film, use poster art, a film still, or a picture of the cast and contributors. {{readMoreLink}}","slide3_title":"Do I need to include my project title in the image?","slide3_description":"Actually, it’s best if you don’t.
